<b>BY AIR</b><br>

3.	From Caticlan Jetty Port, board a boat (P25) or a ferry (P200) going to Boracay island. Terminal fee is P100, plus environmental fee of P75. Travel time is 15-20 minutes. Note: The price increases to P30 for trips from 5:00PM to 10:00PM, and then P100 for trips from 10:00PM to 5:00AM the next day.<br>
4.	From the port, ride a tricycle to where you are staying (P100/ride). The fare from D’Mall to Puka Beach is around P50.<br><br>
<b>BY SEA</b><br>
1.	The cheapest but time-consuming method is via 2GO from Batangas port to Caticlan.<br>

If you come early enough, you can relax and unwind in Puka Beach because it is far from the crowds in Boracay’s three stations. There are no resorts on the beach itself, so bring your own lounge/picnic mats.<br><br>
Wade or swim in the waters, pick a spot and sit down to read a book, have a cold drink or a light snack, get a tan or you can try skimboarding. The waves can get rough depending on the season you visit.<br><br>
Bring some snacks and drinks with you if you plan to have a picnic on the beach. Leave no trace behind.<br><br>
Watch the sunset. Enjoy the warm color of dusk while swimming or just laying on the sand.

    <p class =  "ex1" align = "center">
Boracay is one of the most developed tourist destinations in the country, so you won’t have a difficult time getting cash, accommodation across budgets, transportation, and types of food to eat.<br><br>
Be careful of pickpockets and don’t leave your things unattended.<br><br>
Bring your own skimboard, snorkeling gear or even scuba diving gear if you don’t want to rent.

After enjoying Puka Beach, there is a handful of other things you can do while in Boracay. Go cliff diving in Ariel’s Point, island hopping, helmet diving, scuba diving, eating at the many themed restaurants lining the beach, bar hopping, and watching the magical sunset are just some of the activities you can do.
